## Data source

The data is obtained from the following project:

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

and the initial data set in downloaded from the following url:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip



## Variables

We extract from initial data only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation. We obtain the following list for our variables:
"```{r Subnames, echo=FALSE}"
"colnames <- readLines(""./UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt"")"
"splitNames <- strsplit(colnames, "" "")"
firstElement <- function(x) {x[2]}
"names <- sapply(splitNames, firstElement)"
"selection <- grep(""mean|std"",names)"
Subnames <- names[selection]
"tmp <- c(Subnames, ""activity"")"
"listvariables <- lapply(tmp, function(x) gsub(""[()]"","""", x))"
```


"```{r Display, results=""asis""}"
listvariables
```

## Features

"The original feature file describes well enough the variable since their names has only been slightly changed (removing ""()"" for ""mean()"" and ""std()""). However, there is now a category variable called ""activity"" at the end of the table."

"Concerning the other variables, let us quote the original feature file:"

"> The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. "
"> Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). "
"> Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). "
These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
"'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions."
